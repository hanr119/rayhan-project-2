                In the temples of Japan, on the other hand, a roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the deep, spacious shadows created by the eaves the rest of the structure is built.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-2">
                In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth,
            </p>
            <p class="popup-3">
                and in the pale light of the shadow we put together a house.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-4">
                There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from without it is apparent that they are built to create as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior to as much light as possible.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-5">
                The quality that we call beauty, however, must always grow from the realities of life, and our ancestors, forced to live in dark rooms, presently came to discover beauty in shadows,
            </p>
            <p class="popup-6">
                ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's ends.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-7">
                And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on a variation of shadows,
            </p>
            <p class="popup-8">
                heavy shadows against
            </p>
            <p class="popup-9">
                light shadows-it has nothing else.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-10">
                Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-11">
                We never tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-12">
                And from these delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-13">
                But the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to the shadows.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-14">
                A new painting, even one done in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, can quite destroy the shadows of an alcove, unless it is selected with the greatest care.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-15">
                A Japanese room might be likened to an inkwash painting, the paper-paneled shoji being the expanse where the ink is thinnest, and the alcove where it is darkest. Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully built Japanese room, I marvel at our comprehension of the secrets of shadows,
            </p>
            <p class="popup-16">
                our sensitive use of shadow and light.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-17">
                For the beauty of the alcove is not the work of some clever device. An empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that the light drawn into it forms dim shadows within emptiness.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-18">
                And yet, when we gaze into the darkness that gathers behind the crossbeam, around the flower vase, beneath the shelves, though we know perfectly well it is mere shadow, we are overcome with the feeling that in this small corner of the atmosphere there reigns complete and utter silence; that here in the darkness immutable tranquility holds sway.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-19">
                Where lies the key to this mystery? Illtimately it is the magic of shadows.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-20">
                Were the shadows to be banished from its comers, the alcove would in that instant revert to mere void.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-21">
                This was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the light from this empty space they imparted to the world of shadows that formed there a quality of mystery and depth superior to that of any wall painting or ornament.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-22">
                And the shadows at the interstices of the ribs seem strangely immobile, as if dust collected in the corners had become a part of the paper itself.
