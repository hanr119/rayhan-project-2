                In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth, and in the pale light of the shadow we put together a house.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-2">
                There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew; even from without it is apparent that they are built to create as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior to as much light as possible.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-3">
                If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a Western house is no more than a cap, with as small a visor as possible so as to allow the sunlight to penetrate directly beneath the eaves.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-4">
                A light room would no doubt have been more convenient for us, too, than a dark room.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-5">
                And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on a variation of shadows, heavy shadows against light shadows-it has nothing else.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-6">
                Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the eaves or build on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-7">
                The light from the garden steals in but dimly through paper-paneled doors,
            </p>
            <p class="popup-8">
                and it is precisely this indirect light that makes for us the charm of a room.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-9">
                A luster here would destroy the soft fragile beauty of the feeble light.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-10">
                We have all had the experience, on a visit to one of the great temples of Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a scroll, one of the temple's treasures, hanging in a large, deeply recessed alcove. So dark are these alcoves, even in bright daylight, that we can hardly discern the outlines of the work; all we can do is listen to the explanation of the guide, follow as best we can the all-but invisible brush strokes, and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must be.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-11">
                For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate surface upon which the faint, frail light can play; it performs precisely the same function as the sand-textured wall. This is why we attach such importance to age and patina.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-12">
                Whenever I see the alcove of a tastefully built Japanese room, I marvel at our comprehension of the secrets of shadows, our sensitive use of shadow and light.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-13">
                An empty space is marked off with plain wood and plain walls, so that the light drawn into it forms dim shadows within emptiness.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-14">
                And even we as children would feel an inexpressible chill as we peered into the depths of an alcove to which the sunlight had never penetrated.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-15">
                This was the genius of our ancestors, that by cutting off the light from this empty space they imparted to the world of shadows that formed there a quality of mystery and depth superior to that of any wall painting or ornament.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-16">
                The study bay, as the name suggests, was originally a projecting window built to provide a place for reading. Over the years it came to be regarded as no more than a source of light for the alcove; but most often it serves not so much to illuminate the alcove as to soften the sidelong rays from without, to filter them through paper panels.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-17">
                There is a cold and desolate tinge to the light by the time it reaches these panels.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-18">
                The little sunlight from the garden that manages to make its way beneath the eaves and through the corridors has by then lost its power to illuminate, seems drained of the complexion of life.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-19">
                In temple architecture the main room stands at a considerable distance from the garden; so dilute is the light there that no matter what the season, on fair days or cloudy, morning, midday, or evening, the pale, white glow scarcely varies.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-20">
                The light from the pale white paper, powerless to dispel the heavy darkness of the alcove, is instead repelled by the darkness,
            </p>
            <p class="popup-21">
                creating a world of confusion where dark and light are indistinguishable.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-22">
                Have not you yourselves sensed a difference in the light that suffuses such a room, a rare tranquility not found in ordinary light?
            </p>
            <p class="popup-23">
                a rare tranquility not found in ordinary light?
            </p>
            <p class="popup-24">
                And surely you have seen, in the darkness of the innermost rooms of these huge buildings, to which sunlight never penetrates, how the gold leaf of a sliding door or screen will pick up a distant glimmer from the garden, then suddenly send forth an ethereal glow,
            </p>
            <p class="popup-25">
                a faint golden light cast into the enveloping darkness, like the glow upon the horizon at sunset.
            </p>
            <p class="popup-26">
                How, in such a dark place, gold draws so much light to itself is a mystery to me. 
            </p>
            <p class="popup-27">
                Silver and other metals quickly lose their gloss, but gold retains its brilliance indefinitely to light the darkness of the room.
